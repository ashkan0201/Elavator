This software is an elevator simulator.
It has 5 floors, from the ground floor to the 5th floor.
Its algorithm is similar to normal elevators, this is just a project of elevator movement to understand it better

We placed buttons in the upper right part so that the elevator starts moving when the buttons are pressed.

This software is made with PyGame.

## Installation
